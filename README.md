# FRC Scouting System ðŸ¦ˆ

This is a scouting system for FRC that was developed with the intention of not needing internet for any operation whatsoever. Therefore, the system uses a localhost server that communicates with the scouting devices in the same way that robots communicate with the FMS.

## Installing

```javascript
node server.js
```
All the data goes automatically to the [data.csv](data.csv) file. On any updates on the database the server generates a .json backup file in the [backup](backup) folders.

*You can use any Dashboard software to open and manipulate the [data.csv](data.csv) file.*
